    "A very important parameter to consider when analysing a signal is the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) - a metric that classifies objectively the quality of the acquisition, and like the name suggests, the relation between the intensity of the signal and the undesired noise in the acquired data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SNR values are proportional to the quality of the acquisition. Thus, the higher the value, the better the acquisition, because the higher the influence of the signal relative to the noise. Specifically, the signal is higher than the noise if the SNR is higher than 0 dB and inversely, if it is below 0 dB, the influence of the noise is higher than the influence of the signal and, thus, it might be impossible to recover the signal. \n",
